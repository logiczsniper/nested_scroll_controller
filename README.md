# nested_scroll_controller
![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/nested_scroll_controller)
<br><br>
A widget used in conjunction with a basic [ScrollController](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ScrollController-class.html) to allow for controlling a [NestedScrollView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/NestedScrollView-class.html) like it was a regular scroll view. <br>
This is a small, single-file library which empowers you in every way (and more!) that a standard scroll controller would on a scroll view:
- animate to an offset or an index
- jump to an offset or an index
- add listeners to the total offset
- TODO: utilize NestedScrollPositions with NestedScrollController as you would ScrollPositions with ScrollController!
<br>
#### Usage
TODO: extend this <br>
